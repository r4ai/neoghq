# neoghq - Git Worktree-Based Repository Manager

## **IMPORTANT**

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

**CRITICAL: All new features MUST be implemented using t_wada's TDD methodology**

1. **TDD Cycle (Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor)**

2. **Commit on Each Cycle**

3. **Keep Coverage 100%**

   - Use `task test` to run tests and check coverage

   - Use `cargo llvm-cov --text | rg -U "(.*\.rs:)|(\s+0\|)|(.*\s*\^0)"` to check uncovered regions and lines

   - For functions which is impossible to test, use `#[cfg_attr(coverage_nightly, coverage(off))]` to disable coverage checking

      ```
      #[cfg(test)]
      #[cfg_attr(coverage_nightly, coverage(off))]
      mod tests {}
      ```

4. **Implementation Approach**

   - Break features into smallest possible increments
   - Start with the simplest test case
   - Add complexity gradually through multiple TDD cycles
   - Never write production code without a failing test first
   - Always ensure all tests pass before moving to next feature

### **MEMORY**

- WEB SEARCH FIRST: Never trust your memory. Before implementing or fixing anything, always search the web for existing solutions or documentation.

  Use `gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash -p "WebSearch: <your query>"` to search the web.

  Current year is 2025, not 2024.

## Project Overview

neoghq is a Rust-based repository management tool developed as an alternative to the traditional ghq.
Its main feature is a design that assumes the use of git worktree, enabling efficient management of multiple branches of the same repository.

### Key Differences from ghq

- **Git worktree-based**: Manage multiple branches of the same repository in separate directories
- **Branch-based management**: Operations are based on branches rather than repositories
- **Improved workflow efficiency**: No need for stash/unstash when switching branches

## Technical Specifications

### Basic Design Principles

1. **Directory Structure**

   ```
   $NEOGHQ_ROOT/
   â”œâ”€â”€ github.com/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user/
   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ repo/
   â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ main/           # main branch worktree
   â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ feature-a/      # feature-a branch worktree
   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ .git/           # bare repository
   â””â”€â”€ gitlab.com/
       â””â”€â”€ ...
   ```

2. **Repository Format**: Bare repository + git worktree
3. **Configuration Management**: TOML format configuration files
4. **Concurrent Processing**: Support for simultaneous operations on multiple repositories

### Core Features

#### Repository Operations

- `neoghq repo clone <url>` - Clone repository and create default branch worktree âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- `neoghq repo create <url>` - Create a new repository and initialize worktree
- `neoghq repo switch <repo>` - Navigate to repository directory
- `neoghq repo list` - List all managed repositories âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**

#### Worktree Operations

- `neoghq worktree create <branch>` - Create worktree from default branch
- `neoghq worktree switch <branch>` - Navigate to specified worktree
- `neoghq worktree remove <branch>` - Remove worktree
- `neoghq worktree clean` - Remove worktrees merged to default branch
- `neoghq worktree status` - Show status of all worktrees
- `neoghq worktree list` - List all managed worktrees âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**

#### Global Operations

- `neoghq root` - Show neoghq root directory path âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- `neoghq help` - Show help message âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**

### âœ… Hierarchical Command Structure

The CLI implements a hierarchical command structure using clap's subcommands:

```rust
pub enum Commands {
    Repo {
        #[command(subcommand)]
        command: RepoCommands,
    },
    Worktree {
        #[command(subcommand)]
        command: WorktreeCommands,
    },
    Root,
}
```

**Command Dispatcher**: Fully implemented in `src/commands/mod.rs` with 100% test coverage:
- `execute_command()` - Main dispatcher function
- `execute_repo_command()` - Routes all `repo` subcommands
- `execute_worktree_command()` - Routes all `worktree` subcommands

### Typical Workflow

```bash
# Clone a repository
neoghq repo clone https://github.com/r4ai/readme

# Navigate to the repository
neoghq repo switch r4ai/readme

# Create a new worktree for a feature branch
neoghq worktree create feature/ci

# Switch to the new worktree
neoghq worktree switch feature/ci

# After work is done, remove the worktree
neoghq worktree remove feature/ci

# Clean up merged worktrees
neoghq worktree clean

# List all repositories and worktrees
neoghq repo list
neoghq worktree list
```

## Architecture

### Module Structure

```

â””â”€â”€ error.rs            # Error handling
```

### Dependencies

Key external crates:

- `clap` - CLI argument parsing
- `serde` - Configuration file serialization
- `toml` - Configuration file format support
- `tokio` - Asynchronous processing
- `git2` - Git operations
- `anyhow`, `thiserror` - Error handling

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

1. **Error Handling**

   - Use `anyhow::Result<T>`
   - User-facing error messages support localization

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests: Implemented within each module using `#[cfg(test)]`
   - Integration tests: Implemented in `tests/` directory
   - **Test Requirements**:
     - Use `tempfile` crate for temporary directories/files in tests
     - Achieve 100% code coverage for all new functionality
     - Test both success and error paths
     - Use descriptive test names following `test_<function>_<scenario>` pattern

## Configuration File

Default configuration file path: `~/.config/neoghq/config.toml`

```toml
[general]
root = "~/src/repos"  # neoghq root directory

[git]
default_branch = "main"  # default branch name

[clone]
protocol = "ssh"  # default protocol (ssh/https)
```
